CPIM2
=====

This is a console/text based personal information manager,
i.e. a contact manager, written in standard C (C99)

There are 3 branches which each use a different method
of storing the contacts

master uses vector_void which is how I would do it by default
and what I consider the best and simplest way.

vector_template uses vector_contact and vector_attribute
generated using generate_code.py in my C Vector library.

linked_list uses an intrusive doubly linked list and helper
functions and macros based closely on list.h from the Linux
kernel.


I wrote this for the following reasons:

1. To contrast with my really old C PIM project
available here http://www.robertwinkler.com/projects.php

2. As a platform for reaquainting myself with designing
and writing new code.

3. As a reason to improve my C helper libraries and create
more.  Also to have a something to practice using said
libraries.  It's hard to design a library/API without
actually using it.  It also serves as a "real-life" test
suite.  I think real use is the best kind of testing.

4. To increase my Vim knowledge (ok all programming does this)
